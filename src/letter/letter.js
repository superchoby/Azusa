      Dear Azusa, I hope you have a great day today. For one month we will be
      the same age, cool! That means for one month you don't have to call me
      先輩 or use 敬語 lol. I was thinking of mailing you something but there
      was no guarantee that it would come exactly on your birthday so I hope
      that this present works. Normally, there would be a lot of people there to
      sing and a actual cake but I hope what I did this time was fine. A lot of
      times I smile during the calls because I think about this website idea I
      have for you and sometimes I reeeeaaaaalllllyyyy want to tell you but I
      try my best not to, it took sooooooo much effort lol, especially these
      past few days. I don't know if you ever wondered why I haven't sent you a
      letter yet but if you ever were wondering, it's because of this website. I
      feel like this is the least I could do because you basically give me a
      present everyday with the pictures you send me and with all the fun you
      give me just by talking to you. Oh, and with the amazing drawing you did
      for me. Before we became boyfriend and girlfriend, there were two times
      where I thought this girl is just perfect. One time was when I saw your
      drawing, and the other time was when you told me からかい上手の高木さん
      was one of your top 5 anime lol. I don't know what plans you have today
      outside of your classes but I hope your family does something great for
      you because you deserve it! I feel a little sad that I can't be there to
      celebrate it with you but in the future, I hope to be able to celebrate
      your birthday with you every time! I hope you get very cute presents
      because you are super cute and I think it would be a great match. From,
      Your boyfriend who cherishes you deeply, Thomas Trinh
